Purpose: Shared progress board for parallel agents.

## Update Rules

1. Update this file at start and end of each agent task.
2. Change only your row unless coordinating a handoff.
3. Add a short log line in `Progress Log` for each status change.
4. Keep status values to: `Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Blocked`, `Done`.
